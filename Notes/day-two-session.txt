The Angular Test Bed (ATB):

	- A higher level Angular Only Testing Framework.
	- This allows us to easily test behavious that depends on the Angular Framework.
	
Fixtures and DI:

	Onces the Angular Test Bed is setup, 
	we can use it to instantiate components and resolve depdencies
	
- A fixture is a wrapper for a component and its template.
- We create an instance of a component fixture through the TestBed.
- This injects the Dependency i.e. AuthService into the component constructor.
- We can find the actual component from the componentInstance on the fixture.
- We can get resolve depdencies using TestBed injector by using the get function

Angular Test Bed needs to be used:

	- It allows to easily test change detection algorithm.
	- It allows to test Angular DI framework.
	- It allows to test using the NgMOdule configuration we use in our application.
	- It allows us to test user interation vi clicks and input fields.
